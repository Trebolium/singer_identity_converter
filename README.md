# Singing Voice Conversion with AutoVC
This repository reflects the research presented in our paper A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF LATENT REGRESSOR LOSSES FOR SINGING VOICE CONVERSION, as submitted to the Sound and Music Computing Conference 2023.

Some of the codebase used in the accompaying submodules of this repository have been taken recycled from the AutoVC repository of the AutoVC paper's first author.
